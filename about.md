The *Libraries and Digital Humanities Special Interest Group* (Lib&DH SIG) was established in 2015 by the international Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations [ADHO](http://adho.org/). With conveners from five different countries, the goals of this SIG are:

1. to offer advice and support to librarians engaged in digital humanities pursuits;
2. to advocate for initiatives of interest and benefit to both libraries and digital humanities;
3. to document how librarians and library-based units meet the many challenges, and take advantage of the many opportunities, of DH librarianship;
4. to provide information about available resources and opportunities (e.g., training, funding) that encourage collaboration between DH scholars in a variety of roles, especially in libraries;
5. to showcase the work of librarians engaged in the digital humanities; and to promote librarians’ perspectives and skills in the greater DH community worldwide.
